My pet project. I am a big fan of kite surfing and snowboarding. I've always wanted to try different gear for these sports, but I faced the problem of not having access to such a service. That's why I came up with the idea for this project.

The main idea of the project is an app that provides a service to connect people who are willing to exchange sports equipment on the spot. The benefits for people include the opportunity to try different equipment or gear they plan to buy but are unsure about.

It is built with HTML, CSS, JS. Currently, the app is in the early stages of development and has basic functionality. In the near future, I plan to redesign the app using React.

The app is being developed for use on mobile devices. So please use a mobile browser to access it. 
If you have an Iphone, you can add it to your home screen by selecting the browser's additional menu.
